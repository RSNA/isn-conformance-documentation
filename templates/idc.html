    <h1>Test Cases for Imaging Document Consumer (2018)</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document describes testing requirements for the Imaging
      Document Consumer actor in the IHE XDS-I.b integration profile.
      The
      Imaging Document Consumer will perform tests using the XDS Toolkit
      software from NIST and also ATNA security tests using the Gazelle
      software. The test procedure includes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Execute all tests listed at the bottom of this page without
        TLS</li>
      <li>Repeat all tests listed at the bottom with TLS enabled</li>
      <li>Execute the following No Peer tests that appear in Gazelle for
        your system</li>
      <ul>
        <li>ATNA_Questionnaire</li>
        <li>ATNA_Audit_Msg_Check</li>
        <li>ATNA_Authenticate_with_Tool<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p> The tests for an Imaging Document Source use a fixed set of
      images as input data. The test data has departmental patient
      identifiers in the DICOM files (e.g., those used in the Radiology
      Department when the images are acquired) and identifiers for the
      test Affinity Domain. There is no assigning authority for the
      departmental identifiers. The assigning authority for the Affinity
      Domain is: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>&amp;1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2005.13.20.1000&amp;ISO</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Imaging Document Consumer tests assume a standard testing
      procedure: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A standard test set is created that contains imaging data and
        associated KOS objects. The standard test images are identified
        by patient identifier and are listed with each test as
        appropriate.</li>
      <li>The test software does not provide a mapping mechanism between
        the patient identifier in the image and the patient identifier
        in the Affinity Domain. It is the responsibility of the Imaging
        Document Consumer to use the correct patient identifier for the
        Affinity Domain.</li>
      <li>The Imaging Document Consumer is instructed to send query and
        retrieve requests to the testing system. The logging mechanism
        of the simulators in the testing system records the requests.
        The testing system supports retrieves using the RAD-55 (WADO)
        and RAD-69 (SOAP) transactions. Traditional DICOM C-Move
        transactions are not supported. The Imaging Document Consumer
        under test needs to complete all tests using RAD-55 transactions
        or all tests using RAD-69 transactions. The Imaging Document
        Consumer may test both RAD-55 and RAD-69 transactions if both
        are supported.</li>
      <li>The test manager reviews the Imaging Document Consumer
        requests captured by the test system simulators.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>General Instructions</h2>
    <p>Certain toolkit management functions are password protected and
      must be performed by the test administrator. Please follow these
      general instructions. </p>

    <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In the web user interface, make sure you have selected the
        proper testing ENVIRONMENT and proper testing SESSION.</li>
      <li>In the lower left flap of the toolkit, select Conformance
        Tests.</li>
      <li>Activate the teal/green Test Context control (right side of
        conformance tests). Select your SYSTEM as the system under test.</li>
      <li>Select the Imaging Document Consumer tab.</li>
      <li>Check the Reset box and activate the button: Initialize
        Testing Environment. This will create a set of simulators and
        load test patients into those simulators.</li>
      <li>Wait for the environment initialization steps to complete. You
        should see initilization steps under the heading Supporting
        Environment Configuration turn green.</li>
      <li>The display will show you the configuration parameters for the
        simulator. Use that data to configure your Imaging Document
        Consumer. <em>Please note that you can initialize the
          environment any number of times. The simulators will always be
          created with the same endpoints. You will not have to
          reconfigure your Imaging Document Consumer if you decide to
          initialize the testing environment again.</em></li>
      <li>Imaging Document Consumer tests are not automated. They
        require your system to initiate transactions. You will initiate
        the transactions for each test, and the administrator will
        review query and retrieve requests captured by the testing
        system. The trashcan icon clears the log/test results.</li>
      <li>As stated above, you can run the test cases and review the
        results on your own schedule. Contact the administrator with
        questions or to verify results.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Test Documentation</h2>
    <p>Instructions for individual tests are stored in the toolkit. The
      links below provide static copies of the documentation that do not
      rely on toolkit access.</p>
