    <h1>Test Cases for Initiating Imaging Gateway (2018)</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document describes testing requirements for the Initiating
      Imaging Gateway actor in the IHE XCA-I.b integration profile. The
      Initiating&nbsp; Imaging Gateway will perform tests using the XDS
      Toolkit software from NIST and also ATNA security tests using the
      Gazelle software. The test procedure includes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Execute all tests listed at the bottom of this page without
        TLS</li>
      <li>Repeat all tests listed at the bottom with TLS enabled</li>
      <li>Execute the following No Peer tests that appear in Gazelle for
        your system</li>
      <ul>
        <li>ATNA_Questionnaire</li>
        <li>ATNA_Audit_Msg_Check</li>
        <li>ATNA_Authenticate_with_Tool<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>General Instructions</h2>
    <p>Certain toolkit management functions are password protected and
      must be performed by the test administrator. Please follow these
      general instructions. </p>

    <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In the web user interface, make sure you have selected the
        proper testing ENVIRONMENT and proper testing SESSION.</li>
      <li>In the lower left flap of the toolkit, select Conformance
        Tests.</li>
      <li>Activate the teal/green Test Context control (right side of
        conformance tests). Select your SYSTEM as the system under test.</li>
      <li>Select the Initiating Imaging Gateway tab.</li>
      <li>Check the Reset box and activate the button: Initialize
        Testing Environment. This will create a set of simulators and
        load test patients into that environment.</li>
      <li>Wait for the environment initialization steps to complete. You
        should see initilization steps under the heading Supporting
        Environment Configuration turn green.</li>
      <li>The display will show you the configuration parameters for the
        Document Registry simulator. Use that data to configure your
        Initiating Imaging Gateway. <em>Please note that you can
          initialize the environment any number of times. The simulators
          will always be created with the same endpoints. You will not
          have to reconfigure your Initiating Imaging Gateway if you
          decide to initialize the testing environment again.</em></li>
      <li>Now you can run all tests (one button for the Initiating
        Imaging Gateway - Required Tests, or you can run individual
        tests. The trashcan icon clears the log/test results.</li>
      <li>As stated above, you can run the test cases and review the
        results on your own schedule. Contact the administrator with
        questions or to verify results.</li>
    </ol>
